## Application Architecture

![Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*CMflUPV7nTa7xynr63Q1dw.png)

As shown in the figure, here we have 3 microservices running inside a bridge network. Port 8080 of app0 is exposed. Requests made on app0 is forwarded to appropriate container based on the id parameter provided in the input.

## Deployment

To run this application, go inside DockerCompose directory and run

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This shall shart all three microservices and expose port 8080 of app0. This shall run containers based on images I've provided into the dockerhub.
